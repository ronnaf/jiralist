### File Structure

```bash
modules/
    # `core` includes all shared components
    # we could include these files inside a `component/` to make it adhere to the `module` structure
    # but i think its unnecessary bc i don't think we would connect these files into containers
    core/
    home/ # a module
    navigation/ # module for navigation
        createArnoNavigation.tsx # exports navigate and Navigator, Navigator defines the top-level navigation
        routes.js # route or screen name constants
        TodoStackNavigation.tsx # example navigator, this one is for the `todo` module
    todo/ # example module
        components/ # dumb components
        containers/ # smart components
```
